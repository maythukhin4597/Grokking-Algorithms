## About the book
Grokking Algorithms is a friendly take on this core computer science topic. 
In it, you'll learn how to apply common algorithms to the practical programming problems you face every day. You'll start with tasks like sorting and searching. 
As you build up your skills, you'll tackle more complex problems like data compression and artificial intelligence. 
Each carefully presented example includes helpful diagrams and fully annotated code samples in Python. 
By the end of this book, you will have mastered widely applicable algorithms as well as how and when to use them.
